    <description brief="project-level build tool">
        Autoproj allows to easily install and maintain software that is under
        source code form (usually from a version control system). It has been
        designed to support a package-oriented development process, where each
        package can have its own version control repository (think "distributed
        version control"). It also provides an easy integration of the local
        operating system (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, maybe MacOSX at some point).
